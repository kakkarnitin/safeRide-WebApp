# SafeRide Architecture Document

## Overview
SafeRide is a community-driven web application designed to facilitate the sharing of pickup and drop-off rides for school children. The application connects parents of participating schools, allowing them to offer and avail rides while ensuring a secure and verified environment.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Key Features**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Ride offering and reservation system
  - Credit point management
  - Dashboard for tracking rides and credits
  - Responsive and modern UI

### 2. Backend
- **Technology Stack**: .NET 9, Entity Framework Core
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API for frontend communication
  - User verification workflow
  - Credit point system management
  - Database management using Entity Framework
  - Middleware for exception handling

### 3. Database
- **Database Management System**: SQL Server (or any preferred DB)
- **Key Entities**:
  - Parent
  - RideOffer
  - RideReservation
  - VerificationDocument
  - CreditTransaction

## User Flow
1. **Registration**: Parents register using their email and password. They must upload a driving license and a working with children card for verification.
2. **Verification**: The backend verifies the documents and updates the user's status.
3. **Dashboard**: Verified parents can view their dashboard, which displays their credit balance, offered rides, and ride requests.
4. **Offering Rides**: Parents can post available rides, specifying the number of seats and pickup/drop-off locations.
5. **Availing Rides**: Other parents can search for available rides and reserve seats, which will debit their credit points.
6. **Credit Management**: Each parent starts with 5 credit points. Points are earned by offering rides and spent when availing rides.

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, verification documents) must be encrypted.
- Implement OAuth2 or JWT for secure authentication.
- Ensure proper validation and sanitization of user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

## UI/UX Design
- **Theme**: The application will utilize a modern, clean design with a focus on usability. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling, ensuring a responsive layout.
- **Components**: The UI will consist of reusable components such as buttons, modals, and forms to maintain consistency across the application.

## Conclusion
The SafeRide application aims to create a safe and efficient environment for parents to share rides for their children. By leveraging modern technologies and adhering to best practices in security and design, SafeRide will provide a valuable service to the community.
