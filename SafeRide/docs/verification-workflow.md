# Verification Workflow for SafeRide

## Overview
The verification workflow for the SafeRide application is designed to ensure that only verified parents of participating schools can register and use the platform. This process involves the submission of specific documents and a review by the SafeRide team.

## Steps in the Verification Workflow

1. **Registration Initiation**
   - Parents initiate the registration process by filling out the registration form on the SafeRide application.

2. **Document Submission**
   - During registration, parents are required to upload the following documents:
     - **Driving License**: A valid driving license to confirm the identity and driving capability of the parent.
     - **Working with Children Card**: A card that verifies the parent has undergone background checks and is approved to work with children.

3. **Document Review**
   - Once the documents are submitted, they are sent to the SafeRide verification team for review.
   - The team checks the authenticity and validity of the submitted documents.

4. **Verification Status Update**
   - After the review, the parent will receive a notification regarding their verification status:
     - **Verified**: If the documents are valid, the parent is marked as verified and can access all features of the app.
     - **Not Verified**: If there are issues with the documents, the parent will be notified of the reasons for denial and may be given a chance to resubmit.

5. **Credit Allocation**
   - Upon successful verification, the parent will receive an initial allocation of 5 credit points, which can be used for ride-sharing activities within the app.

6. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - The verification team will periodically review verified accounts to ensure compliance with SafeRide policies.
   - Parents may be required to update their documents periodically or upon request.

## Conclusion
The verification workflow is a critical component of the SafeRide application, ensuring the safety and security of all users. By implementing a thorough verification process, SafeRide aims to build trust within the community and provide a reliable platform for school kids' pickup and drop sharing.
